#Foundations of Web Development 🏗️

This section introduces the basic concepts of web development, covering the structure and function of websites. Topics include:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard language for creating webpages. 📄

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles for presentation of web pages. 🎨

JavaScript: The programming language for creating interactive web pages. 💻

Web Browsers: How browsers interpret and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🌍

Client-Server Architecture: Basic understanding of how web servers and clients (browsers) communicate. 🔄

Web Development Tools: Introduction to code editors, version control systems, and basic debugging tools. 🛠️


#Backend Development with JavaScript 🖥️

Backend development focuses on creating the server-side components of web applications. This section covers:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side. ⚙️

Express.js: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies building web APIs. 🔌

RESTful APIs: Principles and implementation of APIs for communication between client and server. 🔗

Authentication & Authorization: Techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user authentication. 🔒

Error Handling: How to manage and troubleshoot server-side errors. ⚠️

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Rendering pages on the server for performance and SEO benefits. 🚀


#Frontend Development with JavaScript 🎨

Frontend development is all about creating the user interface and experience. This section includes:
